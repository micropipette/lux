Description:
--------------
- Lux is a community dedicated to promoting education and topics such as healthcare and technology through the use of digital multimedia. This includes digital art, photography, videography, music production, and much more.
- In addition to being a space to hang out, ask and answer questions, and talk about multimedia, Lux is also an inter-university club (however all others are all welcome!) that works on projects that aim to positively impact the greater community!
- In order to further promote Lux to expand its community, we decided to create a website for the club that highlights what the club is all about, and reasons why one would join the Lux community. The site also features projects that the club has completed or is underway. Throughout the website, there are links to join the club's discord server, which is where most of the club's operations are held.
